This repository contains the base code used to analyze the Danioheart atlas. Our goal is for the Danioheart atlas to serve as a valuable resource for the scientific community providing a foundation for an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying heart development.

You can access the dataset through the link: [Danioheart Atlas V1](https://bioinformatics-cluster2.mpi-bn.mpg.de/mampok-cluster-bn/danioheart-atlas-v1/cellxgene-fix/)

For the analysis you need the package [SC-Framework](https://github.com/loosolab/SC-Framework/) which provides the tools and jupyter notebooks that we used for the analysis. To run the notebooks, please visit the [SC-Framework](https://github.com/loosolab/SC-Framework/) github page and follow the installation steps.
